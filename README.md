- Hi, I'm bi6mht, and this is my ham radio call sign
- I’m interested in amatuer radio and astronomy(hardware and software)
- On github, I'm going to share some codes for amateur radio astronomy(RA), and maybe some professional ones
- A website(http://radioastronomy.online) is created to share some experiences about amateur RA and you are welcome to visit
- I also share some hardware projects of amateur RA in OSHW Hub(立创开源硬件平台) and my homepage is https://oshwhub.com/bi6mht
