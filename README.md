- Hi, I'm bi6mht, and this is my ham radio call sign
- I’m interested in amatuer radio and astronomy
- On github, I'm going to share some codes for amateur radio astronomy(RA), and maybe some professional ones
- Also, I have created a website(radioastronomy.online) about amateur RA and you are welcome to visit
